# [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com "Odoo's Homepage") Install Script



sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaheenHossain/installScript_01/euriddgarbutt_smartmoves_1769/eagle1769_install.sh

sudo chmod +x eagle1769_install.sh

sudo ./eagle1769_install.sh



## Where should I host Odoo?
There are plenty of great services that offer good hosting. The script has been tested with a few major players such as [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/).
If you'd like you can use my [DigitalOcean referral link](https://m.do.co/c/d605cc420682) which gives you a 200$ voucher for free for the first 60 days.

## Minimal server requirements
While technically you can run an Odoo instance on 1GB (1024MB) of RAM it is absolutely not advised. A Linux instance typically uses 300MB-500MB and the rest has to be split among Odoo, postgreSQL and others. If you install an Odoo you should make sure to use at least 2GB of RAM. This script might fail with less resources too.
There are known issues on DigitalOcean for example where the installation crashes on 1GB RAM machines. See https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript/issues/243
